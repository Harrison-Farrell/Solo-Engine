# Solo-Engine

## Project Summary

Solo-Engine is a high-performance, low-latency 2D game engine designed for building 2D games. This project serves a dual purpose: it is a practical platform for learning the intricacies of game engine development and an exercise to improve and master C++ development skills. This includes with aligning to core C++ Software principles and IDIOMs such as 'SOLID', 'DRY', 'Coupling & Cohesion' principles and the RAII IDIOM.

- S: Single Responsibility Principle
- O: Open-closed Principle
- L: Liskov Substitution Principle
- I: Interface Segregation Principle
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle

- Coupling and Cohesion

## Architecture

The system is designed with a modular approach, where each component is optimized for speed and reliability. By abstracting platform-specific details and focusing on cache-friendly data structures, Solo-Engine provides a robust foundation for building sophisticated 2D games.
